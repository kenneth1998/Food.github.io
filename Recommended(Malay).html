Judging on a superficial level will probably do their soups injustice because they aren’t starchy or thick, and look, in fact, like any other soup would; but what distinguishes their soups is their characteristic taste. Most willv have their soup served with bread, the roti benggali, which is handmade. If you’re feeling adventurous, they have the sup torpedo, which is the bull’s penis soup. They also serve the usual mamak fare, such as nasi kandar, nasi lemak and roti canai.</span><br class="auto-style1"/>

								<span class="auto-style1">Lekor or Keropok lekor is a traditional Malay fish cracker snack originated from the state of Terengganu, Malaysia.

 			<span class="auto-style1">This unassuming small house at Balik Pulau has baffled many straightaway; you’ll feel like stepping into Terengganu or Kelantan as three women are stocking up a reputation for delivering the best Keropok Lekors in Penang. As early as 6 am the preparations get going and served at a nearby stall in the late afternoon. Unlike the crispier ones you get from the east coast, the deep-fried lekor here is much soft, chewy and packed with strong fishy flavours and accompanied with the best mate – chili sauce. It's sinfully addictive; you’ll just gobble down as many batons as you can while admiring the untouched nature of Balik Pulau.</span><br class="auto-style1"/>

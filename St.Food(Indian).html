								<span class="auto-style1">Mee Goreng in Penang is rather unique on its own, with the various kinds of selection which includes Cuttlefish, To Fu, Bean Sprouts, Egg, Yellow Noodles and Potatoes.
								We can find a few decent ones in Penang and this is definitely one of my favorites. Situated at Sin Hup Aun Cafe, which near Pulau Tikus Market.</span><br class="auto-style1"/> 
			
			<br class="auto-style1"/> 
								<span class="auto-style1">If you have been patronizing the area frequently, you would have known or at least heard of this humble stall of Mee Goreng which has been operating for years. Mee Goreng lovers who tasted his Mee Goreng are coming back for more over the years and nothing has changed since then.
								It is situated at 11-37, Jalan Pasar, Taman Pulau Pinang, 10350, Georgetown, Penang and it opens from 8am to 6:30pm. Closes every Tuesday.<br />

								<span class="auto-style1">A combo of under-the-sea delights and fresh crisp vegetables, this dish is not only a healthy, scrumptious sweet/sour delight.
								A list of pasembur in Penang would not be complete without the mention of the famous stalls at the Gurney Drive hawker centre and it opens everyday from 6pm to 12pm</span><br class="auto-style1"/>
			<br class="auto-style1"/>
								<span class="auto-style1">Even Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak had to make a surprise stop at this food court last year to enjoy the pasembur. Among the stalls here is stall 09, which serves specialties such as squid, prawns and fried crabs.</span><br class="auto-style1"/>

								<span class="auto-style1">	Penang‘s Famous Sweet Dessert, known as the ‘Apom Manis’ is one of the best I have ever eaten.Located on Kuching Street, Pulau Tikus, just outside the New Cathay coffeeshop, this Indian man has been selling his sweet Apom since 1974.</span><br class="auto-style1"/>
			<br class="auto-style1"/> 
								<span class="auto-style1">	His father’s secret recipe is what keeps patrons coming back for more, and I totally agree. For RM3 you can get 6 pieces of Apom Manis. This is one of the best Apom I have eaten to date. 
															Never had a softer, fluffier, more eggy apom in my life! Some types of apom have a harder crumbly texture, but this one when served piping hot and fresh was literally flaking and tearing off at the seams..it was that billowy soft.</span><br class="auto-style1"/>
			<br class="auto-style1"/>
								<span class="auto-style1">	Fly-away-apom I like to call it. And the characteristic puffed up center is sweet, eggy and soft. If clouds in the sky had a texture, it would be like this apom here. The shop opens from 6am till 10am everyday except for thursday and can be contacted at 012-4707039</span><br class="auto-style1"/>

															Ali Coffee Shop has brought the nasi lemak indulgence to another level by having them stir fried, then topped with fried egg. 
															This humble food stall is operating 24 hours daily, located at the simple sheltered space at Jalan Lunas side walk. It served as an alternative sinful supper for us since the day we tried.</span><br class="auto-style1"/>
			<br class="auto-style1"/> 
								<span class="auto-style1">	The stall is mostly busy during the night around 10p, to 12pm as that is when those people who have finished their job and are planning to have supper before heading home </span><br class="auto-style1"/>
			<br class="auto-style1"/>
								<span class="auto-style1">  This big plate of Nasi Lemak Goreng Special (RM 9) came with stir fried nasi lemak and fried egg, with addition of fried chicken. For the non special version (RM 6), there will be no fried chicken. A little bit of burning kick from the sambal, 
															with the crunchy biting pleasure from anchovies. Pop the egg yolk and letting it ooze all over the rice.	</span><br class="auto-style1"/>

<p class="auto-style1"> <h3 class="auto-style3"> Micke's Place </h3>
<span class="auto-style1">Nasi Briyani is certainly a most loved among the supporters. Its solid flavor and welcoming yellowish shading are best joined with different dishes. The store is located at 96, Love Lane, 10200, Georgetown, Penang and it opens everyday from 12pm till 3am.  </span><br class="auto-style1"/> 
			
<br class="auto-style1"/> 
<span class="auto-style1">Chulia Street is massively jam-packed with big breakfasts, coffees, pastries and street food galore. Fueled with gastronomic vibes, we discovered a little lively restaurant along Love Lane serving Lamb briyani that charms your tastebuds.
						  Micke’s Place has breathed innovative and rustic backdrop that sets it apart from other cafes – swamp of signatures harmonising the walls, classic ornaments and old-school photos.<br/> The briyani is aromatic, lusciously laden with chunks of tender lamb meat and paired with refreshing raitha and piping hot curry. 
						  Being a minuscule cafe, you’ll definitely by hook or crook squeeze into the last available seat to pleasure your palate. End with their Masala tea, which is rich and complements the zesty aftertaste of the briyani. They can be reached by calling them at 012-4938279 <br /> </span>

								<span class="auto-style1"> </span><br class="auto-style1"/>
			<br class="auto-style1"/> 
								
 			 <span><br class="auto-style1"/>
 						<span class="auto-style1"><span class="auto-style1">A 24-hour joint that merits the number two spot only because Line Clear Nasi Kandar’s food tempts us with its ‘limited-time’ offerings. 
 																			Line Clear is located in a narrow alleyway along Jalan Penang, with wooden tables and chairs, slightly near open drains. Don’t let that put you off though! In all honesty the food here is phenomenal and the fact that you only pay RM6.50 (the cheapest in all of Penang) for a plate of rice, fried chicken, telur dadar (sunny side up omelette), vegetables and ‘kuah banjir’ (a mix of gravies), 
 																			makes the whole meal that much more satisfying. There is an impressive amount of hype about their daily specials (ranging from fish curry to beef gravy) and the extensive praise is clearly warranted. Adding to the whole value-for-money aspect of Line Clear Nasi Kandar is the fact that the food served comes in generous portions.
